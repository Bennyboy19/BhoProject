# BhoProject

I created two programs. 
The Bho Stuff folder is my visual studio program with all the files in there and my WebAPI is the rest of the files.
I had a little trouble organizing all of the files but i should work correctly. This allows you to use internet explorer
and it allows auto login for www.gnc.com, www.myuhc.com, and www.wingstop.com. Make sure to register the BHO first as well.
